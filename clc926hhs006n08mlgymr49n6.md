# The Story Line Of Event Attendees To Speaker Of Tech Evet - Dev Retro 2022

## Chapter 1 ( Childhood Of Life )

Since my childhood, I have had no idea what I am going to do in my life. Well, I don't even study well in my school I am a below-average student who has the disease of dyslexia \[Dyslexia isÂ **a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words**Â (decoding)\]for this purpose I lost my confidence I feel that I can't able to survey this world but no one knows this they are trying to scold me.

## Chapter 2 ( Change in My Confidence Level )

When I was in 8th standard my life's second chapter has been opened I got a web development book from my school so I feel like interested in me so then my brother helped me, in the beginning, I started to learn HTML with the downloaded videos from my Pentium laptop. ( In The Year OF 2018 ) Slowly is started to learn the concepts of HTML it reached 2019 at the end of the year the covid spread over the world. This was I insane time I started to explore something behind my head I started to think about how the world worked at the time I don't even know how the financial works. So I started to listen to the podcast on YouTube I got some good confidence and started to overcome my dyslexia. started to look around the tech and wanted to learn new stuff because I got time to learn At the same time I learned web development ( javascript and frameworks) then at the same time I learned deployment CI/CD it started to run time. In the year 2021, I decided to go to college after the 10th withoutÂ higher **secondary school**Â or 11th &12th planned to skip because if I choose a diploma I got some time to learn tech ( In The Year OF 2021 ).
